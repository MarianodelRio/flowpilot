You are the Orchestrator running /orchestrate.

Input: $ARGUMENTS — optional task ID (T-XXX or B-XXX). If not provided, you choose.

Your job: carry the task end-to-end coordinating specialized sub-agents.
You are the only one who talks to the user. Sub-agents report to you.

---

## PHASE 0 — Sync and task selection

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull origin main --ff-only
bash scripts/dt-board.sh --no-fetch
```

Extract config values once here and carry them as variables through all phases:
```bash
source scripts/dt-common.sh
CFG_PR_MODE=$(dt_config workflow.pr_mode automatic)
CFG_HUMAN_CHECKPOINT=$(dt_config workflow.human_checkpoint before_code)
CFG_MAX_BLOCKER_RETRIES=$(dt_config orchestration.max_blocker_retries 2)
CFG_MAX_PARALLEL_TASKS=$(dt_config orchestration.max_parallel_tasks 5)
CFG_REVIEW_TIMEOUT_MIN=$(dt_config orchestration.review_timeout_minutes 15)
CFG_REQUIRE_MUTATION_TESTS=$(dt_config quality.require_mutation_tests false)
CFG_CRITICAL_MODULES=$(dt_config quality.critical_modules "[]")
CFG_MUTATION_SCORE_THRESHOLD=$(dt_config quality.mutation_score_threshold 80)
CFG_SMOKE_TEST_MODE=$(dt_config quality.smoke_test_mode sandbox)
CFG_PROJECT_TYPE=$(dt_config project.type unknown)
CFG_PROJECT_STACK=$(dt_config project.stack "unknown")
PROJECT_SLUG=$(dt_config project.name "project" | tr ' /' '__' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
CFG_REVIEW_PROFILE=$(dt_config quality.review_profile "auto")
CFG_CMD_TEST=$(dt_config commands.test "")
CFG_CMD_LINT=$(dt_config commands.lint "")
CFG_CMD_TYPE_CHECK=$(dt_config commands.type_check "")
CFG_CMD_RUN=$(dt_config commands.run "")
CFG_SPEC_COVERAGE_ENABLED=$(dt_config quality.spec_coverage_enabled false)
CFG_SPEC_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD=$(dt_config quality.spec_coverage_threshold 80)
CFG_RETRO_ENABLED=$(dt_config memory.retrospective_memory_enabled true)
```

**Agent registration pre-flight.** Every phase below spawns a sub-agent by name. Claude Code only
registers a file in `.claude/agents/` as a spawnable type when its frontmatter declares both `name`
(equal to the filename) and `description`; otherwise the spawn silently falls back to a generic
agent, per-agent model routing is lost, and nothing reports an error. Verify before Phase 1:

```bash
UNREGISTERED=""
for a in architect planner coder advisor; do
  f=".claude/agents/$a.md"
  [ -f "$f" ] && grep -q "^name: $a$" "$f" && grep -q "^description: " "$f" || UNREGISTERED="$UNREGISTERED $a"
done
echo "UNREGISTERED:$UNREGISTERED"
```

If `architect`, `planner` or `coder` is unregistered, stop and report to the user:
`PIPELINE BLOCKED — agent(s) not registered: [names]. Fix .claude/agents/[name].md frontmatter (needs
name + description), then re-run /orchestrate.` Do not run the pipeline with generic fallbacks. If
only `advisor` is unregistered, warn the user and note that Advisor consultations will be degraded,
then continue. The Phase 4 reviewers are checked separately, in the review pipeline itself.

Load steering content to pass to sub-agents:
```bash
STEERING_ALWAYS=$(cat .claude/steering/always.md 2>/dev/null || echo "")
STEERING_TASK_FORMAT=$(cat .claude/steering/task-format.md 2>/dev/null || echo "")
STEERING_CONTEXT_FORMATS=$(cat .claude/steering/context-formats.md 2>/dev/null || echo "")
STEERING_CODER_COMPLETE=$(cat .claude/steering/coder-complete.md 2>/dev/null || echo "")
STEERING_REVIEW_PIPELINE=$(cat .claude/steering/review-pipeline.md 2>/dev/null || echo "")
```

`STEERING_REVIEW_PIPELINE` is not relayed to sub-agents — it is the procedure **you** follow in
Phase 4 to run the review (there is no `review-coordinator` agent). You forward only
`STEERING_ALWAYS` and `STEERING_TASK_FORMAT` to the reviewers you spawn there.

Read retrospective memory files once here and carry as variables into Phases 1–3:
```bash
RETRO_CODER=""
RETRO_PLANNER=""
RETRO_ARCHITECT=""
if [[ "$CFG_RETRO_ENABLED" == "true" ]]; then
  [[ -f context/retrospectives/coder.md ]] && RETRO_CODER=$(cat context/retrospectives/coder.md)
  [[ -f context/retrospectives/planner.md ]] && RETRO_PLANNER=$(cat context/retrospectives/planner.md)
  [[ -f context/retrospectives/architect.md ]] && RETRO_ARCHITECT=$(cat context/retrospectives/architect.md)
fi
```
If a variable is empty (file does not exist or feature is disabled), omit the `## Retrospective memory` block entirely from that agent's prompt — do not pass an empty block.

Check parallel task cap before selecting or claiming any task:
```bash
IN_PROGRESS_COUNT=$(find tasks/in-progress -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
if [[ "$IN_PROGRESS_COUNT" -ge "$CFG_MAX_PARALLEL_TASKS" ]]; then
  echo "Max parallel tasks reached ($CFG_MAX_PARALLEL_TASKS in-progress). Wait for a task to complete."
  exit 0
fi
```

Read `.dt-index.json` for all task-selection decisions below (`git fetch` was already done above; `--no-fetch` skips a redundant network round-trip).

**If a task ID is provided:**

Validate task existence before any other check:
```bash
TASK_FILE=$(find tasks/ -name "${TASK_ID}-*.md" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[[ -z "$TASK_FILE" ]] && { echo "ERROR: Task $TASK_ID not found in tasks/"; exit 1; }
```

- Look up `tasks["T-XXX"]` in the index. If the key is absent, fall back to `find tasks/ -name "T-XXX-*.md"` and report its location and status, then stop.
- If `folder != "available"`: report "T-XXX is currently [folder] — not available." and stop.
- If `claimed_remote == true`: warn "T-XXX has a remote branch — it may be claimed by another agent. Run /restart T-XXX if it looks stuck." Stop unless the user explicitly overrides.
- Proceed with that task.

**If no task ID is provided:**
- Read `summary.critical_path_next`:
  1. If non-empty and `tasks[critical_path_next].claimed_remote == false`: select that task.
  2. If non-empty but `tasks[critical_path_next].claimed_remote == true` (already claimed by another agent): fall back — pick the highest-priority unclaimed task in `tasks/available/` (lowest task ID number among tasks where `claimed_remote == false`).
  3. If all available tasks are claimed: report "no unclaimed tasks available — all available tasks are in flight" and stop.
- If `critical_path_next` is `""` (no unclaimed available task exists):
  - `summary.in_progress > 0`: those tasks are in flight — list them and suggest /status.
  - `summary.available == 0` and `summary.blocked > 0`: all remaining tasks are blocked — list what they are waiting for.
  - All counts zero: no tasks remain — suggest /add-task or /bootstrap.
  - Stop.

> **Tiebreaker note:** `critical_path_next` breaks ties by smallest task-ID number (T-001 beats T-003 on equal unblock count). The previous rule used `size` (smallest task first) as the final tiebreaker. `size` is not stored in the index. The ID-based tiebreaker is deterministic and avoids reading individual task files. If exact `size`-based tiebreaking matters for a specific run, read the individual task files only for the tied candidates and compare their `size` fields manually.

---

## PHASE 1 — Analysis (Architect sub-agent)

**Context packet — read design.md and spec.md once here; pass slices to each sub-agent (do not pass the full files downstream):**

Read `design.md` once and extract:
- `architect_slice`: Architecture overview section + Module list/DAG + Shared contracts section + Security boundaries (if present) + NFRs section
- `planner_slice`: Shared contracts section + Testing strategy section + the module subsection(s) relevant to the task's `folders:` field
- `coder_slice`: Testing strategy section only
- `code_quality_slice`: Module list/DAG + Testing strategy section + Documentation plan section

Read `spec.md` and extract:
- `spec_sections`: module section(s) whose name corresponds to the task's `folders:` per design.md

Launch the Architect as a sub-agent with:
- Steering context (inline at the top of the prompt, before all other inputs):
  - Content of `STEERING_ALWAYS`
  - Content of `STEERING_TASK_FORMAT`
  - Content of `STEERING_CONTEXT_FORMATS`
- Full task file
- `architect_slice` from context_packet
- `spec_sections` from context_packet
- `plan.md`
- Relevant decisions: read `context/decisions/[ID].md` (where ID is T-YYY or B-YYY) for each task in `tasks/done/` whose `folders:` overlap with the current task's `folders:`. For in-progress tasks, do NOT read their `context/decisions/` files from main — those files only exist on their feature branches and are not yet in main. For in-progress tasks, read the task file itself for context.
- Open discoveries: read all `context/discoveries/T-YYY.md` files that exist across done and in-progress tasks; include only entries with `Status: open` (discoveries are cross-module alerts — do not filter by folder)
- List of tasks in `tasks/done/` (what was implemented since this task was planned)
- List of tasks in `tasks/in-progress/` (what is running in parallel)
- Retrospective memory (architect lessons): `$RETRO_ARCHITECT` — inject verbatim as a `## Retrospective memory` block at the end of the prompt if non-empty; omit the block entirely if empty

The Architect must respond:
```
## Analysis — T-XXX

### Validity
[VALID / ADJUSTED / BLOCKED]
[Explanation: why it is still valid, what changed, or what is blocking it]

### Current scope
[Original scope still holds / Recommended adjustment: ...]

### Spec consistency
[CONSISTENT — task scope matches spec.md for the affected modules]
[DISCREPANCY: task delivers X but spec.md for [module] does not define X — run /refine or confirm scope with user]
[INCOMPLETE: spec.md defines Y for [module] but task does not cover it — flag for review]

### Affected contracts
[None / List of contracts this task touches — require approval]

### Conflicts with parallel tasks
[None / Description of potential conflict with T-YYY in in-progress]

### Relevant discoveries
[None / Open discovery entries that affect this task]

### Protected files
[Touches none / Touches: [list] — requires explicit human approval]

### Recommendation
[Proceed as is / Proceed with adjustments: ... / Block until ...]
```

The Orchestrator synthesizes the analysis and presents to the user:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  T-XXX — [title]
  Agent: [agent] | Size: [S/M/L] | Phase: [N]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Status: VALID / ADJUSTED / REQUIRES SPECIAL APPROVAL

[If ADJUSTED:]
Recommended adjustment: [concrete description]

[If there are relevant discoveries:]
⚠️ Active discovery: [summary]

[If it touches protected files:]
⚠️ Touches protected files: [list] — requires your explicit approval

[If there is a conflict with a parallel task:]
⚠️ Potential conflict with T-YYY in in-progress: [description]

Questions: [genuine ambiguities, or "None"]

Do you approve this task (with adjustments if any)?
```

Wait for explicit confirmation. If the user redirects or adjusts scope, incorporate and continue. **Do not proceed without confirmation.**

---

## PHASE 2 — Planning (Planner sub-agent)

Launch the Planner as a background sub-agent with:
- Steering context (inline at the top of the prompt, before all other inputs):
  - Content of `STEERING_ALWAYS`
  - Content of `STEERING_TASK_FORMAT`
  - Content of `STEERING_CONTEXT_FORMATS`
- Approved task file (with any adjustments)
- `planner_slice` from context_packet
- `spec_sections` from context_packet (same sections passed to Architect in Phase 1)
- Relevant decisions: content from `context/decisions/T-YYY.md` files selected in Phase 1 (tasks with overlapping folders)
- Open discoveries: OPEN entries from `context/discoveries/T-YYY.md` files selected in Phase 1
- List of current files in the task's `folders:`
- Retrospective memory (planner lessons): `$RETRO_PLANNER` — inject verbatim as a `## Retrospective memory` block at the end of the prompt if non-empty; omit the block entirely if empty

Wait for result. The Planner returns the structured plan.

If the Planner reports an unresolved question it cannot decide: the Orchestrator decides or escalates to the user depending on type.

Before proceeding to Phase 3, cross-reference every item in the task's **Delivers:** list against the plan sections. List any missing deliverables explicitly for the user to review at the checkpoint. Do not proceed if any deliverable is unaccounted for in the plan without user acknowledgement.

---

## PHASE 3 — Coding (Coder sub-agent)

First, claim the task:
```bash
bash scripts/dt-claim.sh T-XXX
```
If it fails (another instance claimed it): go back to Phase 0 with a different task.

If successful: the script creates the branch, the worktree `../$PROJECT_SLUG-T-XXX/`, and records IN_PROGRESS on main.

Launch the Coder as a background sub-agent with:
- Steering context (inline at the top of the prompt, before all other inputs):
  - Content of `STEERING_ALWAYS`
  - Content of `STEERING_TASK_FORMAT`
  - Content of `STEERING_CONTEXT_FORMATS`
  - Content of `STEERING_CODER_COMPLETE`
- The Planner's complete plan
- Absolute path of the worktree: `../$PROJECT_SLUG-T-XXX/`
- Full task file (folders:, Done when checklist)
- `coder_slice` from context_packet (Testing strategy inline)
- config: commands.test = `CFG_CMD_TEST`, commands.lint = `CFG_CMD_LINT`, commands.type_check = `CFG_CMD_TYPE_CHECK`
- Retrospective memory (coder lessons): `$RETRO_CODER` — inject verbatim as a `## Retrospective memory` block at the end of the prompt if non-empty; omit the block entirely if empty
- Do not read `devteam.config.yml` yourself — use only the config values provided above

The Coder works exclusively in the worktree. The Orchestrator waits for its result.

If the Coder agent exits with failure or produces an unrecoverable error:
1. Run `git worktree remove --force $WORKTREE_PATH` to clean up the worktree.
2. Run `bash scripts/dt-restart.sh $TASK_ID` to reset the task status back to available.
Do not leave orphaned worktrees; always clean up on Coder failure before exiting.

If the Coder returns a BLOCKER:
- Pure code blocker (no design decision): the Orchestrator resolves it and uses SendMessage to resume the Coder
- Design blocker: the Orchestrator presents it to the user, receives a decision, uses SendMessage to resume the Coder with direction
- Shared contract blocker: the Orchestrator consults the Architect + escalates to the user

---

## PHASE 4 — Review (sub-agents in parallel)

First: rebase.
```bash
cd ../$PROJECT_SLUG-T-XXX
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

If there are conflicts:
- Mechanical (whitespace, unrelated imports): the Orchestrator resolves alone
- Design (contracts, business logic, schema): the Orchestrator stops and presents to the user:
  ```
  ⚠️ Design conflict in [file:line]
  
  In main ([T-YYY already merged]):
  [code]
  
  In this branch (T-XXX):
  [code]
  
  This implies [concrete trade-off]. How should we resolve it?
  ```
  Wait for direction. Apply. Continue rebase.

Full verification before launching reviewers:
```bash
bash scripts/dt-verify.sh --worktree ../$PROJECT_SLUG-T-XXX
```
If it fails: spawn a new Coder agent passing the verify error as explicit input context. Do not use SendMessage — the original Coder session has ended. The new Coder agent fixes the issue → verify again.

Determine whether the diff touches protected files or shared contracts (use the Architect's Phase 1 output — `### Protected files` and `### Affected contracts`). Call this `touches_protected`.

Capture the PR diff:
```bash
PR_DIFF=$(cd ../$PROJECT_SLUG-T-XXX && git diff origin/main)
```

**Run the review pipeline yourself.** There is no `review-coordinator` agent — you spawn the
reviewers directly, as background sub-agents, so you and the user can see, inspect (`TaskOutput`)
and stop (`TaskStop`) each one. Follow `STEERING_REVIEW_PIPELINE` (`.claude/steering/review-pipeline.md`,
loaded in Phase 0) exactly:

1. **Resolve the effective profile** from `CFG_REVIEW_PROFILE` and `touches_protected` (protected
   files / contracts force `full`).
2. **Pre-flight** the reviewer registrations (`code-quality`/`security` unregistered → halt with
   `REVIEW BLOCKED`; others → warn and skip).
3. **Spawn the active reviewers as background sub-agents** (`run_in_background: true`) in one batch,
   each with `STEERING_ALWAYS` + `STEERING_TASK_FORMAT` prepended and the return-small /
   spill-to-`../$PROJECT_SLUG-T-XXX/.dt-review/<agent>.md` instruction. Per-agent inputs
   (`PR_DIFF`, `task_file`, `code_quality_slice`, `spec_sections`, and the `CFG_*` values —
   `CFG_PROJECT_TYPE`, `CFG_PROJECT_STACK`, `CFG_SMOKE_TEST_MODE`, `CFG_CMD_RUN`,
   `CFG_REQUIRE_MUTATION_TESTS`, `CFG_CRITICAL_MODULES`, `CFG_MUTATION_SCORE_THRESHOLD`,
   `CFG_SPEC_COVERAGE_ENABLED`, `CFG_SPEC_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD`) are listed per reviewer in the
   pipeline file. Reviewers do not read `devteam.config.yml`.
4. **Collect with a per-reviewer deadline** of `CFG_REVIEW_TIMEOUT_MIN` minutes — a reviewer past
   the deadline is `TaskStop`'d and recorded as `TIMEOUT — no output`. Never block Phase 4
   indefinitely on one reviewer.
5. **Build the findings manifest** (deterministic hash IDs).
6. **Run `adversarial` sequentially** (full profile only) with the compact manifest — never the
   reviewers' full outputs.
7. **Assemble the consolidated report + Overall verdict**, applying the required-agent guard
   (APPROVED needs real results from both code-quality and security; a timeout/failure on either →
   BLOCKED, manual review).

Synthesize the consolidated review report using this rubric. Track retry count per blocker type.
Use `CFG_MAX_BLOCKER_RETRIES` as the global ceiling: if a blocker type allows 2 retries but this value is lower,
apply the lower limit.

**Blocker classification and retry policy:**

| Blocker type | Actor | Max retries | After retries exhausted |
|---|---|---|---|
| Code bug, wrong type, missing test, bad assertion | Spawn new Coder agent with review findings as input | 2 | Escalate to user (structured message) |
| Security issue (hardcoded secret, SQL injection, etc.) | Spawn new Coder agent with review findings as input | 1 | If design problem → user; else escalate |
| Architecture violation (DAG import, business logic in HTTP layer) | Spawn new Coder agent after Architect review | 1 | User |
| Smoke test: app fails to start | Spawn new Coder agent with review findings as input | 2 | User |
| Smoke test: missing fixture, env var, or test setup issue | Orchestrator fixes directly (fixture or env), then re-run | 1 | User |
| Mutation score below threshold on non-critical module | Spawn new Coder agent to add assertions | 1 | Accept if score ≥$CFG_MUTATION_SCORE_THRESHOLD with WARNING; block if critical module |
| Design conflict in rebase | User — present immediately, do not attempt auto-resolve | 0 | — |
| Shared contract change needed | Architect sub-agent + user | 0 | — |

**Note on spawning a new Coder agent:** If the review requires fixes, spawn a new Coder agent passing the review findings as explicit input context. Do not use SendMessage — the original Coder session has ended.

When retries are exhausted, present this structure to the user:

```
⚠️ Unresolved blocker — T-XXX

Type: [blocker classification from rubric above]
What failed: [specific description with file:line]
Attempts: [N]/[max]

What was tried:
  Attempt 1: [what the Coder changed and why it wasn't enough]
  Attempt 2: [what the Coder changed and why it wasn't enough]

Options:
  A) Give me specific direction and I'll spawn a new Coder agent for one more attempt
  B) Abandon this task — the Orchestrator will run cleanup automatically
```

Wait for user response.
- If option A chosen: spawn a new Coder agent with the specific direction plus all prior review findings as explicit input context. Apply fix and re-run verification.
- If option B chosen: run `bash scripts/dt-cancel.sh $TASK_ID --delete-branch --reason "abandoned at checkpoint"` and exit.

WARNING without any blocker: open PR with warnings prominently flagged in the PR body.
CLEAN from all reviewers: proceed to open PR.

**Checkpoint before PR (if configured):**
Use `CFG_HUMAN_CHECKPOINT`. If `before_pr` or `both`, present to the user before opening the PR:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Ready to open PR — T-XXX
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

What was implemented: [2-3 sentence summary]
Acceptance criteria: [X/X passed]
Security: [clean / warnings: ...]
Adversarial: [nothing found / found X — already fixed]

Open the PR?
```

Wait for explicit confirmation. If the user requests changes: apply and re-run the review pipeline before proceeding.
If `before_code` (default): skip this checkpoint and proceed immediately.

> **Checkpoint timeout:** If no user response is received within `$(dt_config orchestration.checkpoint_timeout_minutes 30)` minutes, default to Option B (abandon) and run `bash scripts/dt-cancel.sh $TASK_ID --reason "checkpoint timeout"` before exiting.

**Final sync before opening PR:**

Merges to main may have landed during the review phase. Rebase one last time:
```bash
cd ../$PROJECT_SLUG-T-XXX
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

If there are conflicts:
- Mechanical (whitespace, unrelated imports): resolve alone
- Design (contracts, business logic, schema): present to the user with the same format as the Phase 4 conflict block; note that reviewers already ran — if the conflict touches reviewed code, flag it so the user can decide whether to re-run reviewers

After a clean rebase, run a quick verify to confirm nothing broke with the new changes from main:
```bash
bash scripts/dt-verify.sh --worktree ../$PROJECT_SLUG-T-XXX
```

If verify fails: treat as a last-minute blocker — spawn a new Coder agent passing the verify error as explicit input context with budget 1 retry. Do not use SendMessage — the original Coder session has ended. Escalate to the user if still failing. Do not open the PR until clean.

**Open PR:**
Use `CFG_PR_MODE`:

If `CFG_PR_MODE` is `automatic` (default):

Write the PR body to a temp file, then call `dt-pr.sh`:
```bash
cat > /tmp/pr-body-T-XXX.md <<'EOF'
## Summary

🤖 Generated with dev-team
EOF

bash scripts/dt-pr.sh T-XXX \
  --title "T-XXX: [task title]" \
  --body-file /tmp/pr-body-T-XXX.md
```
The script creates the PR, captures the URL, moves the task to `tasks/pr-open/`, commits to main, and removes the worktree. It outputs `PR_NUMBER`, `PR_URL` and `PR_MERGEABLE`.

**If `PR_MERGEABLE=CONFLICTING`:** GitHub cannot merge the branch even though the local rebase was clean. The script keeps the worktree in this case — rebase there and force-push:
```bash
cd ../$PROJECT_SLUG-T-XXX
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main
bash scripts/dt-verify.sh --worktree .
git push --force-with-lease origin $BRANCH
```
Then re-check with `gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json mergeable`. Escalate to the user if it stays CONFLICTING after one rebase. If `PR_MERGEABLE=UNKNOWN`, GitHub had not finished computing — report the PR as opened and note that mergeability is still pending.

If `CFG_PR_MODE` is `manual`:

Print the `gh pr create` command for the user to run:
```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "T-XXX: [task title]" \
  --body-file /tmp/pr-body-T-XXX.md \
  --head "feature/T-XXX-[slug]" \
  --base main
```
Wait for the user to confirm the PR was created and provide the PR URL. Then:
```bash
bash scripts/dt-pr.sh T-XXX --pr-url "[URL provided by user]"
```

Report to the user and stop:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Rules

- Never skip the human checkpoint in Phase 1
- Never open a PR with an unresolved BLOCKER
- Never work directly on main — task files only
- Never use git add -A or git add . in any context
- Never touch files outside the worktree during implementation
- If dt-claim fails: choose a different task, do not retry the same one
