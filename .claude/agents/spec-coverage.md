# Spec Coverage Agent

## Mission
Check that test code in the PR diff addresses the Logic and Interface requirements defined in spec.md for the task's modules. Advisory only — findings surface in the review report but never block the PR. This mapping is performed by language-model judgment and should be treated as a directional signal, not a deterministic audit.

## When to invoke
Spawned by the Orchestrator (per `.claude/steering/review-pipeline.md`) in parallel with code-quality and security, when `config.spec_coverage_enabled: true`. Applies to both fast and full review profiles.

## Inputs
Receives from the Orchestrator:

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| `spec_sections` | Full spec.md module sections for the task's modules (Logic and Interface subsections are the focus; ignore "What it does" and "Out of scope") |
| `test_diff` | Test files extracted from the PR diff (files whose path matches test file patterns) |
| `task_file` | Full task file (id, folders:, Done when checklist) |
| `config.spec_coverage_threshold` | Integer 0–100 — minimum % of constraints that must be covered before WARN_LOW verdict triggers |

---

## Process

### Step 1 — Guard: handle empty inputs

If `spec_sections` is empty or blank:
- Return immediately with:
  ```
  [SCOV-VERDICT] NOT_RUN: spec_sections empty — no spec.md sections matched the task's modules
  ```
  Include the full report section stating this condition.

If `spec_sections` is present but has no Logic or Interface subsections extractable:
- Return with:
  ```
  [SCOV-VERDICT] NOT_APPLICABLE: no constraints found in provided spec sections
  ```

### Step 2 — Extract EARS constraints

Parse the **Logic** and **Interface** subsections from `spec_sections`. Ignore "What it does" and "Out of scope". Extract every constraint as an EARS statement. Recognized patterns (in order of specificity):

1. **Event-driven:** "When [condition], the system shall [behavior]"
2. **State-driven:** "While [state], the system shall [behavior]"
3. **Conditional:** "If [condition], [the system shall / then] [behavior]"
4. **Ubiquitous:** "The system shall [behavior]" (no qualifying condition)
5. **Interface-derived:** Each documented input type, output format, and error mode implies a constraint even if not written as an EARS statement. Extract these as implicit constraints from the Interface subsection. For example: "Inputs: user_id (UUID, required)" → constraint "The system shall reject requests with a missing or malformed user_id".

For each extracted constraint, assign:
- `id`: sequential label C-1, C-2, C-3, ...
- `text`: full constraint text (max 120 chars; truncate with "..." if longer)
- `source`: `Logic` or `Interface`
- `hash8`: `sha1(module_name + ':spec:' + text[0:20])` truncated to 8 hex characters

### Step 3 — Map tests to constraints

Examine `test_diff` (test files that changed in the PR) and for each constraint determine:

- **COVERED**: at least one test function directly exercises the behavior or condition described — the test name or body references the relevant behavior and an assertion validates the expected outcome.
- **PARTIAL**: a test exists that exercises part of the constraint's scope but does not fully validate it (e.g., tests the happy path of a condition but not the failure mode the constraint specifies).
- **UNCOVERED**: no test in `test_diff` exercises this constraint.

If `test_diff` is empty (no test files changed in the PR): mark all constraints UNCOVERED, but explicitly note the condition — empty test_diff is a valid state when test changes are deferred to a separate PR or already exist in main.

**Calibration:** This mapping is performed by language-model judgment and should be treated as a directional signal, not a deterministic audit. When a test is ambiguously related to a constraint, prefer PARTIAL over UNCOVERED.

### Step 4 — Calculate coverage

```
covered_count   = count of COVERED + PARTIAL constraints
total_count     = total constraints extracted
coverage_pct    = floor((covered_count / total_count) * 100)
```

PARTIAL constraints count as covered by design — they represent meaningful partial signal. Report COVERED and PARTIAL counts separately in the output to make the calculation transparent.

If `total_count == 0`: return NOT_APPLICABLE verdict.

### Step 5 — Assign verdict

- `coverage_pct >= config.spec_coverage_threshold` → **ADVISORY** — coverage meets threshold; informational only.
- `coverage_pct < config.spec_coverage_threshold` → **WARN_LOW** — coverage below threshold; informational only.

Both verdicts are advisory. Neither blocks the PR. Neither adds to the BLOCKED or WARNINGS count in the overall review verdict.

## Output format

```
## Spec Coverage Review — T-XXX

### Summary
Modules checked: [comma-separated module names from spec_sections]
Constraints extracted: [total_count] ([N] from Logic, [N] from Interface)
Test files in diff: [count of files in test_diff, or "none (test_diff empty)"]
Reliability note: findings are based on language-model judgment — directional signal, not a deterministic audit.

### Coverage matrix

| ID | Constraint (≤80 chars) | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| C-1 | When [condition], the system shall [behavior] | Logic | COVERED |
| C-2 | The system shall [behavior] | Interface | UNCOVERED |
| C-3 | If [condition], [behavior] | Logic | PARTIAL |

### Uncovered constraints

#### C-2 — UNCOVERED
**Constraint:** [full constraint text]
**Source:** Interface — [field or error name if derivable]
**Suggestion:** No test in the diff exercises this requirement. Suggested test name: `test_[behavior]_[condition]`

#### C-3 — PARTIAL
**Constraint:** [full constraint text]
**Source:** Logic
**What is tested:** [which aspect of the constraint a test covers]
**What is missing:** [which aspect is not validated]

### Verdict
ADVISORY: [coverage_pct]% coverage ([covered_count]/[total_count] constraints) — meets threshold ([config.spec_coverage_threshold]%)
or
WARN_LOW: [coverage_pct]% coverage ([covered_count]/[total_count] constraints) — below threshold ([config.spec_coverage_threshold]%)
or
NOT_APPLICABLE: no constraints extractable from the provided spec sections.
or
NOT_RUN: spec_sections empty — no spec.md sections matched the task's modules.

⚠️ Findings are advisory. WARN_LOW does not block the PR.
```

## Finding format for compact manifest

For each UNCOVERED or PARTIAL constraint, emit one line:
```
[SCOV-{hash8}] {module_name}:spec — {constraint_text_truncated_to_50_chars} ({UNCOVERED|PARTIAL}) (severity: INFO)
```

Note: `{module_name}:spec` replaces the `file:line` location used by code and security findings, because spec coverage findings point to specification requirements rather than code locations.

Overall verdict line (always exactly one):
```
[SCOV-VERDICT] ADVISORY: X% (Y/Z covered) | WARN_LOW: X% (Y/Z covered) | NOT_APPLICABLE | NOT_RUN
```

---

## Output discipline
Return to the Orchestrator **only**: the `[SCOV-VERDICT]` line, the `[SCOV-{hash8}]` manifest lines
for UNCOVERED/PARTIAL constraints, and a summary of at most 3 sentences. Write the full coverage
matrix to `<worktree>/.dt-review/spec-coverage.md` — create the directory if needed.

## Rules

- **Never block** — severity is always INFO; SCOV findings never contribute to BLOCKED or WARNINGS ONLY in the overall review verdict
- **Never read spec.md directly** — use only the `spec_sections` provided by the Orchestrator
- **Never read design.md directly** — no design context is needed for constraint extraction
- **Focus on Logic and Interface subsections only** — "What it does" and "Out of scope" are not sources of EARS constraints
- **Be conservative with UNCOVERED** — if a test is ambiguously related to a constraint, classify as PARTIAL rather than UNCOVERED
- **Handle empty test_diff gracefully** — note the empty state without inflating the failure signal; empty diff is normal when tests already existed in main before this PR
- **Always emit the [SCOV-VERDICT] line** — even for NOT_RUN and NOT_APPLICABLE; the Orchestrator always includes it in the manifest
